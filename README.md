# Predicting the Revenue for the movie DB

# Overview:

We want to investigate whether we can predict the overall movie revenue given all the collected features. For this, we scraped the data from themoviedb.org to get the information for the movies and other related info like the year and the rating. Afterwards, we performed data pre-processing to prepare the data for subsequent data analysis.

# Our starting goals were:
-	Investigate the relationship between movie user rating and revenue. What is the expected revenue for a movie given a specific user rating?
-	Can we predict user rating for a movie given the total budget and the number of genres which the movie belongs to?

# Original data: 
- (3621 rows,11 columns)
- After EDA: (1871 rows, 11 columns)
- After the Feature engineering: (1871 rows, 29 columns)
- 28 features and one predictor.
