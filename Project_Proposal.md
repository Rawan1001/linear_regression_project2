# Movies Regression
# Project proposal:
In this project our task is to scrape a website to get the data for the Exploratory Data Analysis and then design a regression model to predict the possible revenues of movies for production companies. 


# The Approach:
Our plan in the project is to find:
- Scrape the data from themoviedb.org to get the information for the movies and other related info like the year and the rating.
- Scrape the website box office to get the related information like:
The budget, the revenue for the movies, the release date, and the price of the tickets. 



# Question(s):
- Investigate the relationship between movie user rating and revenue. What is the expected revenue for a movie given a specific user rating?
-	Can we predict user rating for a movie given the total budget and the number of genres which the movie belongs to?


# Data Description:

-	Name of the movie (Title)
-	Genre Count
-	Genre
-	Cast Size
